## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to describe rules around

1. var  
2. let  
3. const  
4. object leterals

## var
Never use the term var for any reason or purpose.

## let
Use let for any local variable that will change during the executing time of the code.

## const
Const is a bit more interesting because people are use to just adding var as the declaration.  
Often we declare varialbes for objects that only change once in the execution.  
"const" is the prefered declaration for all objects that only change once.

This applies to assigning modules and values.

## object leterals
Javascript is really powerfull and the use of object literals as parameters is a very powerfull feature.  
Since typescript is the language of choice, transpiling down into javascript, always declare types for typescript benifits.
If you are using third party libraries and typings are not available, you can use object leterals.
