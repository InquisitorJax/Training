## Introduction
This section will describe the condition code has be before it is considered as done.  
This document assumes the use of [build-utilities](https://github.com/caperavensoftware/build-utilities).  


1. All classes and functions must be covered using unit tests.
2. Code coverage must be 100%.
3. All unit tests must pass and there should be no pending tests outstanding.
4. There must be no missing tests for classes.
5. There must be no html audit errors.
6. All ui must be tested using end to end testing.

## Code Review 
Before code is considered done, it needs to undergo review.  
If code does not pass a full audit no code review is done until it passes full audit.  
The first step of a review is running a full audit on the code before continuing with the review.
