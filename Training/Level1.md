# Level 1 - Getting Started
Things you need to know before you can start writing applications

There are three main technologies that you must know to write any web application:

1. HTML  
2. CSS  
3. Javascript  

We also use a side technology to assist in writing javascript called typescript.  
Even though we use Typescript it is still important to understand the fundamentals of ES2015 as you will use many javascript features.
