# Project 1

## Introduction
This project is the creation of a todo appliction using only:

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Javascript

If you like you can add some basic styling but don't worry about looks in this project.
The main goal is to introduce you to javasript in a practical way and how to interact with the DOM.

## Goals
The goals with this training is to get the developer familiar with the basics of web development.
No frameworks to worry about, just plain old javascript.
To some degree this is a bit more difficult to work with but the lessons are important.
Here you will learn the fundamentals you will use again in web components.
