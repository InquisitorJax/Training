# Level 1 Project 3
This project will extend project 0.1 and add some interaction to it.

Using the [level 0 layout](https://github.com/pragmaproducts/Training/blob/master/Images/project0.png) please update the layout so that on mobile:

1. Sidebar is not visible by default
1. Swipe from right to left to show the side bar.
1. The open sidebar must take up 90% of the screen.
1. The last 10% of the screen must be covered with a semi transparent black layer with a 25% transparency.
1. If the sidebar is open and you swife from left to right you hide the sidebar again.
1. All transitions must be animated using [CSS transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions).

On desktop do nothing.
