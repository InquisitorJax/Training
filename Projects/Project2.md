# Project 2

## Introduction
Rewrite Project 1 using the build-utilities.
https://github.com/caperavensoftware/build-utilities.

The application should be tested on multiple browsers on different devices.
This includes firefox, chrome on desktop. Test the application on atleast one mobile device.

Please note that this project must also be added to github please.

## Starting a new project
Please read these instructions.
https://github.com/caperavensoftware/build-utilities/wiki/Installing

If you feel that part of these instructions are unclear or additional steps required, please let me know so that I can update it.

## Technology 
From this point you will start using supporting technologies.

1. Typescript for your coding
2. Sass for css development

You will also start writing tests for your projects must have a keen understanding of:

1. Mocha
2. Chai
3. Sinon

The user interface part of the application uses aurelia as the framework.
http://aurelia.io/

If you need a reference on the Aurelia api you can look at their cheat sheet.

## NB
Please use the build utilities generators to create the classes for your project.
https://github.com/caperavensoftware/build-utilities/wiki/Generators

The build utilities will put everything in place for you to start writing your application.

## Goals
Take what you have learned and make it a practical application.

### Features required
All the same Project 1 features are expected.
In addition to that we require:

1. Proper UI styling using Sass
2. 100% test coverage
3. All audits to pass on all code and html.

See the build utilities wiki for more details on the what auditing is available.
